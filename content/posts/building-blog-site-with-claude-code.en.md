I built this blog site together with Claude Code. Here I document the process from tech stack selection to writing.

## Why Blog with Claude Code

I recently started using Claude Code seriously for coding work. Following that thread, I thought "maybe I can build a blog with it too?"

I've tried starting a blog several times before, but always gave up because polishing and fact-checking felt too tedious. Maybe things would be different with a coding agent. With that hope, I set up this blog.

## Tech Stack: Hugo + PaperMod

Decided after consulting with Claude Code.

It said "Hugo for simple blogs, Astro if customization matters more." This time I prioritized getting the blog up and running over customization, so I chose Hugo. Content is in Markdown, and migration costs would be low if I leave it to Claude Code.

For the theme, I discussed requirements like "multilingual support, lightweight, long-term stability" and landed on PaperMod.

## Writing Workflow

It's not fully automated generation—Claude Code is just support. I want to write blogs as a medium to record my own thoughts, so I use Claude Code as a tool to make things easier.

Here's how I'm thinking about it:

1. Tell Claude Code roughly what I want to write, have it create the framework
2. Iteratively modify content through dialogue
3. Sometimes edit directly myself
4. Polish together with Claude Code at the end
5. Have Claude Code translate, then review

## Conclusion

It's just getting started, so I don't know yet how much Claude Code will help with blog writing.

But at least, it feels more fun now.

I'll continue trying this writing workflow in future posts.
