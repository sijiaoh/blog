In the context of Agile development and Lean Startup, many people have probably seen this diagram.

This was actually drawn by Henrik Kniberg around 2016 to explain MVP (Minimum Viable Product). However, this diagram is often misunderstood.

I myself initially thought "this diagram seems off." But upon reflection, the problem wasn't with the diagram—it was with how I interpreted it.

Only after checking the original source did I realize that the creator himself is aware of the misunderstanding problem.

## Common Misunderstandings

### "A skateboard can't become a car"

I often see criticisms like "A bike and a car aren't on the same trajectory" or "You can't modify a skateboard into a car."

But that's just nitpicking the metaphor. This diagram isn't about actual automobile development. It's an analogy to communicate a product development philosophy in an accessible way.

Such pedantic criticism misses the point entirely.

### "If users want a car, you should build a car"

Some also say "If users want a car and you give them a skateboard, they'll be furious."

But the key point here is: **neither the user nor the developer knows if a car is the right answer**.

What users actually want is to solve a transportation problem. Even if a car turns out to be the right answer, hitting that answer on the first try is extremely difficult.

Also, look closely at the bottom row of the diagram. The product that makes the user happiest is the convertible. While the user is smiling at the final product in the top row too, the satisfaction level isn't as high as in the bottom row.

This answer could only be reached because feedback was gathered and incorporated at each stage.

## An Often-Overlooked Perspective

There's another perspective that's rarely discussed.

**Only well-funded large corporations can choose the top development process.**

New ventures and startups cannot endure a situation where revenue is zero until the product is complete. They need to raise funds, acquire users, and evolve their product simultaneously.

In other words, the bottom process isn't just "a better choice"—**in many cases, it's the only choice**.

## The Creator Recognized the Misunderstanding

Henrik Kniberg himself is aware that this diagram is easily misunderstood. He wrote the following on his blog:

> And remember – the skateboard/car drawing is just a metaphor. Don't take it too literally :o)
>
> — [Making sense of MVP - Henrik Kniberg](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp)

Furthermore, in the same article, he mentioned that the term "MVP" itself causes confusion, and stated that he has come to prefer the following expressions:

- **Earliest Testable Product**
- **Earliest Usable Product**
- **Earliest Lovable Product**

Not "Minimum" but "Earliest." This more clearly conveys the essential purpose: to get feedback as early as possible.

## Conclusion

"A skateboard can't become a car." "If users want a car, build a car."—If you think this way, take a step back and reconsider.

I believe the message this diagram conveys is: **Don't aim for perfection from the start. Ship early, learn early.**

This is a way of thinking that aligns with Agile, and should be applicable to everyday development as well.
